Kubernetes (version 1.3 through to the latest , and likely onwards) lets you use
[Container Network Interface](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingcni)
(CNI) plugins for cluster networking. You must use a CNI plugin that is compatible with your
cluster and that suits your needs. Different plugins are available (both open- and closed- source)
in the wider Kubernetes ecosystem.

A CNI plugin is required to implement the
[Kubernetes network model](docsconceptsservices-networking#the-kubernetes-network-model).

You must use a CNI plugin that is compatible with the
[v0.4.0](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingcniblobspec-v0.4.0SPEC.md) or later
releases of the CNI specification. The Kubernetes project recommends using a plugin that is
compatible with the [v1.0.0](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingcniblobspec-v1.0.0SPEC.md)
CNI specification (plugins can be compatible with multiple spec versions).

# # Installation

A Container Runtime, in the networking context, is a daemon on a node configured to provide CRI
Services for kubelet. In particular, the Container Runtime must be configured to load the CNI
plugins required to implement the Kubernetes network model.

Prior to Kubernetes 1.24, the CNI plugins could also be managed by the kubelet using the
`cni-bin-dir` and `network-plugin` command-line parameters.
These command-line parameters were removed in Kubernetes 1.24, with management of the CNI no
longer in scope for kubelet.

See [Troubleshooting CNI plugin-related errors](docstasksadminister-clustermigrating-from-dockershimtroubleshooting-cni-plugin-related-errors)
if you are facing issues following the removal of dockershim.

For specific information about how a Container Runtime manages the CNI plugins, see the
documentation for that Container Runtime, for example

- [containerd](httpsgithub.comcontainerdcontainerdblobmainscriptsetupinstall-cni)
- [CRI-O](httpsgithub.comcri-ocri-oblobmaincontribcniREADME.md)

For specific information about how to install and manage a CNI plugin, see the documentation for
that plugin or [networking provider](docsconceptscluster-administrationnetworking#how-to-implement-the-kubernetes-network-model).

# # Network Plugin Requirements

# # # Loopback CNI

In addition to the CNI plugin installed on the nodes for implementing the Kubernetes network
model, Kubernetes also requires the container runtimes to provide a loopback interface `lo`, which
is used for each sandbox (pod sandboxes, vm sandboxes, ...).
Implementing the loopback interface can be accomplished by re-using the
[CNI loopback plugin.](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingpluginsblobmasterpluginsmainloopbackloopback.go)
or by developing your own code to achieve this (see
[this example from CRI-O](httpsgithub.comcri-oocicniblobrelease-1.24pkgocicniutil_linux.go#L91)).

# # # Support hostPort

The CNI networking plugin supports `hostPort`. You can use the official
[portmap](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingpluginstreemasterpluginsmetaportmap)
plugin offered by the CNI plugin team or use your own plugin with portMapping functionality.

If you want to enable `hostPort` support, you must specify `portMappings capability` in your
`cni-conf-dir`. For example

```json

  name k8s-pod-network,
  cniVersion 0.4.0,
  plugins [

      type calico,
      log_level info,
      datastore_type kubernetes,
      nodename 127.0.0.1,
      ipam
        type host-local,
        subnet usePodCidr
      ,
      policy
        type k8s
      ,
      kubernetes
        kubeconfig etccninet.dcalico-kubeconfig

    ,

      type portmap,
      capabilities portMappings true,
      externalSetMarkChain KUBE-MARK-MASQ

  ]

```

# # # Support traffic shaping

**Experimental Feature**

The CNI networking plugin also supports pod ingress and egress traffic shaping. You can use the
official [bandwidth](httpsgithub.comcontainernetworkingpluginstreemasterpluginsmetabandwidth)
plugin offered by the CNI plugin team or use your own plugin with bandwidth control functionality.

If you want to enable traffic shaping support, you must add the `bandwidth` plugin to your CNI
configuration file (default `etccninet.d`) and ensure that the binary is included in your CNI
bin dir (default `optcnibin`).

```json

  name k8s-pod-network,
  cniVersion 0.4.0,
  plugins [

      type calico,
      log_level info,
      datastore_type kubernetes,
      nodename 127.0.0.1,
      ipam
        type host-local,
        subnet usePodCidr
      ,
      policy
        type k8s
      ,
      kubernetes
        kubeconfig etccninet.dcalico-kubeconfig

    ,

      type bandwidth,
      capabilities bandwidth true

  ]

```

Now you can add the `kubernetes.ioingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.ioegress-bandwidth`
annotations to your Pod. For example

```yaml
apiVersion v1
kind Pod
metadata
  annotations
    kubernetes.ioingress-bandwidth 1M
    kubernetes.ioegress-bandwidth 1M
...
```
