This page describes security considerations and best practices specific to the Windows operating system.

# # Protection for Secret data on nodes

On Windows, data from Secrets are written out in clear text onto the nodes local
storage (as compared to using tmpfs  in-memory filesystems on Linux). As a cluster
operator, you should take both of the following additional measures

1. Use file ACLs to secure the Secrets file location.
1. Apply volume-level encryption using
   [BitLocker](httpsdocs.microsoft.comwindowssecurityinformation-protectionbitlockerbitlocker-how-to-deploy-on-windows-server).

# # Container users

[RunAsUsername](docstasksconfigure-pod-containerconfigure-runasusername)
can be specified for Windows Pods or containers to execute the container
processes as specific user. This is roughly equivalent to
[RunAsUser](docsconceptssecuritypod-security-policy#users-and-groups).

Windows containers offer two default user accounts, ContainerUser and ContainerAdministrator.
The differences between these two user accounts are covered in
[When to use ContainerAdmin and ContainerUser user accounts](httpsdocs.microsoft.comvirtualizationwindowscontainersmanage-containerscontainer-security#when-to-use-containeradmin-and-containeruser-user-accounts)
within Microsofts _Secure Windows containers_ documentation.

Local users can be added to container images during the container build process.

* [Nano Server](httpshub.docker.com_microsoft-windows-nanoserver) based images run as
  `ContainerUser` by default
* [Server Core](httpshub.docker.com_microsoft-windows-servercore) based images run as
  `ContainerAdministrator` by default

Windows containers can also run as Active Directory identities by utilizing
[Group Managed Service Accounts](docstasksconfigure-pod-containerconfigure-gmsa)

# # Pod-level security isolation

Linux-specific pod security context mechanisms (such as SELinux, AppArmor, Seccomp, or custom
POSIX capabilities) are not supported on Windows nodes.

Privileged containers are [not supported](docsconceptswindowsintro#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers-securitycontext)
on Windows.
Instead [HostProcess containers](docstasksconfigure-pod-containercreate-hostprocess-pod)
can be used on Windows to perform many of the tasks performed by privileged containers on Linux.
