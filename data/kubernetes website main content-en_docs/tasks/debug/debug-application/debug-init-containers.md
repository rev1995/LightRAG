This page shows how to investigate problems related to the execution of
Init Containers. The example command lines below refer to the Pod as
`` and the Init Containers as `` and
``.

# #  heading prerequisites

* You should be familiar with the basics of
  [Init Containers](docsconceptsworkloadspodsinit-containers).
* You should have [Configured an Init Container](docstasksconfigure-pod-containerconfigure-pod-initialization#create-a-pod-that-has-an-init-container).

# # Checking the status of Init Containers

Display the status of your pod

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

For example, a status of `Init12` indicates that one of two Init Containers
has completed successfully

```
NAME         READY     STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
   01       Init12   0          7s
```

See [Understanding Pod status](#understanding-pod-status) for more examples of
status values and their meanings.

# # Getting details about Init Containers

View more detailed information about Init Container execution

```shell
kubectl describe pod
```

For example, a Pod with two Init Containers might show the following

```
Init Containers

    Container ID    ...
    ...
    State           Terminated
      Reason        Completed
      Exit Code     0
      Started       ...
      Finished      ...
    Ready           True
    Restart Count   0
    ...

    Container ID    ...
    ...
    State           Waiting
      Reason        CrashLoopBackOff
    Last State      Terminated
      Reason        Error
      Exit Code     1
      Started       ...
      Finished      ...
    Ready           False
    Restart Count   3
    ...
```

You can also access the Init Container statuses programmatically by reading the
`status.initContainerStatuses` field on the Pod Spec

```shell
kubectl get pod nginx --template .status.initContainerStatuses
```

This command will return the same information as above in raw JSON.

# # Accessing logs from Init Containers

Pass the Init Container name along with the Pod name
to access its logs.

```shell
kubectl logs  -c
```

Init Containers that run a shell script print
commands as theyre executed. For example, you can do this in Bash by running
`set -x` at the beginning of the script.

# # Understanding Pod status

A Pod status beginning with `Init` summarizes the status of Init Container
execution. The table below describes some example status values that you might
see while debugging Init Containers.

Status  Meaning
------  -------
`InitNM`  The Pod has `M` Init Containers, and `N` have completed so far.
`InitError`  An Init Container has failed to execute.
`InitCrashLoopBackOff`  An Init Container has failed repeatedly.
`Pending`  The Pod has not yet begun executing Init Containers.
`PodInitializing` or `Running`  The Pod has already finished executing Init Containers.
