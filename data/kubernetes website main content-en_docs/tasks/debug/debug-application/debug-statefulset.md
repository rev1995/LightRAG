title Debug a StatefulSet
content_type task
weight 30
---

This task shows you how to debug a StatefulSet.

# #  heading prerequisites

* You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
* You should have a StatefulSet running that you want to investigate.

# # Debugging a StatefulSet

In order to list all the pods which belong to a StatefulSet, which have a label `app.kubernetes.ionameMyApp` set on them,
you can use the following

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.ionameMyApp
```

If you find that any Pods listed are in `Unknown` or `Terminating` state for an extended period of time,
refer to the [Deleting StatefulSet Pods](docstasksrun-applicationdelete-stateful-set) task for
instructions on how to deal with them.
You can debug individual Pods in a StatefulSet using the
[Debugging Pods](docstasksdebugdebug-applicationdebug-pods) guide.
