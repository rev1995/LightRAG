This page shows how to create a Kubernetes Service object that exposes an
external IP address.

# #  heading prerequisites

* Install [kubectl](docstaskstools).
* Use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine or Amazon Web Services to
  create a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial creates an
  [external load balancer](docstasksaccess-application-clustercreate-external-load-balancer),
  which requires a cloud provider.
* Configure `kubectl` to communicate with your Kubernetes API server. For instructions, see the
  documentation for your cloud provider.

# #  heading objectives

* Run five instances of a Hello World application.
* Create a Service object that exposes an external IP address.
* Use the Service object to access the running application.

# # Creating a service for an application running in five pods

1. Run a Hello World application in your cluster

    code_sample fileserviceload-balancer-example.yaml

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f httpsk8s.ioexamplesserviceload-balancer-example.yaml
   ```
   The preceding command creates a

   and an associated
   .
   The ReplicaSet has five

   each of which runs the Hello World application.

1. Display information about the Deployment

   ```shell
   kubectl get deployments hello-world
   kubectl describe deployments hello-world
   ```

1. Display information about your ReplicaSet objects

   ```shell
   kubectl get replicasets
   kubectl describe replicasets
   ```

1. Create a Service object that exposes the deployment

   ```shell
   kubectl expose deployment hello-world --typeLoadBalancer --namemy-service
   ```

1. Display information about the Service

   ```shell
   kubectl get services my-service
   ```

   The output is similar to

   ```console
   NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)    AGE
   my-service   LoadBalancer   10.3.245.137   104.198.205.71   8080TCP   54s
   ```

   The `typeLoadBalancer` service is backed by external cloud providers, which is not covered in this example, please refer to [this page](docsconceptsservices-networkingservice#loadbalancer) for the details.

   If the external IP address is shown as , wait for a minute and enter the same command again.

1. Display detailed information about the Service

   ```shell
   kubectl describe services my-service
   ```

   The output is similar to

   ```console
   Name           my-service
   Namespace      default
   Labels         app.kubernetes.ionameload-balancer-example
   Annotations
   Selector       app.kubernetes.ionameload-balancer-example
   Type           LoadBalancer
   IP             10.3.245.137
   LoadBalancer Ingress   104.198.205.71
   Port            8080TCP
   NodePort        32377TCP
   Endpoints      10.0.0.68080,10.0.1.68080,10.0.1.78080  2 more...
   Session Affinity   None
   Events
   ```

   Make a note of the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) exposed by
   your service. In this example, the external IP address is 104.198.205.71.
   Also note the value of `Port` and `NodePort`. In this example, the `Port`
   is 8080 and the `NodePort` is 32377.

1. In the preceding output, you can see that the service has several endpoints
   10.0.0.68080,10.0.1.68080,10.0.1.78080  2 more. These are internal
   addresses of the pods that are running the Hello World application. To
   verify these are pod addresses, enter this command

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods --outputwide
   ```

   The output is similar to

   ```console
   NAME                         ...  IP         NODE
   hello-world-2895499144-1jaz9 ...  10.0.1.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
   hello-world-2895499144-2e5uh ...  10.0.1.8   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
   hello-world-2895499144-9m4h1 ...  10.0.0.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-5v7a
   hello-world-2895499144-o4z13 ...  10.0.1.7   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
   hello-world-2895499144-segjf ...  10.0.2.5   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-cpuc
   ```

1. Use the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) to access the Hello
   World application

   ```shell
   curl http
   ```

   where `` is the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`)
   of your Service, and `` is the value of `Port` in your Service
   description.
   If you are using minikube, typing `minikube service my-service` will
   automatically open the Hello World application in a browser.

   The response to a successful request is a hello message

   ```shell
   Hello, world!
   Version 2.0.0
   Hostname 0bd46b45f32f
   ```

# #  heading cleanup

To delete the Service, enter this command

```shell
kubectl delete services my-service
```

To delete the Deployment, the ReplicaSet, and the Pods that are running
the Hello World application, enter this command

```shell
kubectl delete deployment hello-world
```
