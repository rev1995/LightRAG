I am developing a rag pipeline. I need to create this rag with use of Gemini llm, gemini tokenizer, efficient chunking text logic. To get started with LightRAG core, refer to the sample codes available in the examples folder thne develop production ready end to end full rag pipleline. I have given source coud for lightrag, lightrag api and lightrag web-ui, refer them to include all features like.

Note:
- Do not hallucinate code or logic.
- This program uses the default storage settings for LightRAG, so all data will be persisted to WORKING_DIR/rag_storage only for now time being.
- Do not use pip install for lightrag or lightrag api since i have source code you should build from the source code only.
- use the cacheing logic in the lightrag more effectivety wherever needed with more robust implementation and also the user able to clear the LLM response cache with different mode.
- use effecient Reranker Model Configuration. When a Reranker model is enabled, it is recommended to set the "mix mode" as the default query mode.
- i need to able to select QueryParam to control the behavior your query in the webUI.
- User Prompt vs. Query
When using LightRAG for content queries, avoid combining the search process with unrelated output processing, as this significantly impacts query effectiveness. The user_prompt parameter in Query Param is specifically designed to address this issue — it does not participate in the RAG retrieval phase, but rather guides the LLM on how to process the retrieved results after the query is completed. Here's how to use it:

# Create query parameters
query_param = QueryParam(
mode = "hybrid", # Other modes：local, global, hybrid, mix, naive
user_prompt = "For diagrams, use mermaid format with English/Pinyin node names and Chinese display labels",
)

# Query and process
response_default = rag.query(
"Please draw a character relationship diagram for Scrooge",
param=query_param
)
print(response_default)
- create .env files with necessary configuration, i need below values should be taken from env only so no default values should be given inside the code and if you want to add anything you can add. 
- Data Isolation Between LightRAG Instances
- Multimodal Document Processing (RAG-Anything Integration)
- inlcude Token Usage Tracking
